\begin{abstract}
Here we introduce a handy tool in the form of a \textbf{mobile application} for Nokia devices running the Maemo 5 operating system, that may be used by readers who often frequent the library or book stores. Once presented with a variety of books to choose from the most common one would do to keep a track of the books he wishes to buy or read later would be to write down various details about the book and later refer to it. In today's world, the mobile phone has become an integral part of every individual's lifestyle. Moroever, with the advent of smart devices that are capable of connecting to the internet anywhere and also availability of packet data at affordable prices to the end user, we felt the need to make this job easier. The idea was to come up with such a system that minmizes the work that is to be done by the user. We therefore exploit the \textbf{ISBN number} which is encoded in the form of an \textbf{EAN13 barcode} on the back cover of almost all the books, which provides us with all the required information. All the user needs to do is start the application, point the phone at barcode on the back cover of the book and take a picture of the barcode. The application scans the barcode to obtain the ISBN number and fetches the details such as Title, Author, Publisher and even a concise summary of the book content from a website and stores this information in the phone. In the application is a search feature that can be used to later retrieve the information that has already been saved. The search is keyword based, so the user can type a part of the title, author or publisher to search for the book information that has already been stored.
